        <section id="about">
            <p>We are a team of five high schoolers who wanted to do something productive with our newfound free time. 
                As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we have found in our own families a shortage of certain food items, 
                like milk or eggs. However, with the situation as bad as it is, we found it risky to head out to a grocery 
                store, where there are dozens of other people. Eliminating human contact to the bare minimum has become the
                 standard, along with washing hands, in fighting this pandemic. Getting groceries delivered would be a great 
                 option, but we found that many other people also think the same way, backing up grocery stores so that they
                  have little or no available delivery times. Our vision was to create a centralized platform where people in
                   the community could find other people in the community and obtain the goods they need by trading or buying.
                    This is far safer than traveling to a grocery store, as the contact is only with one person, or if a drop-off 
                    and pick-up is arranged, no contact at all.</p>
