Objectives:
 * for fishFood, make image foodBit that comes out of container
    - we (i.e. Jamie + Ryan) can make two or three different shapes for the foodBits so that the animation looks more authentic

 * make function dragContainer that allows the user to drag fishFood from the right side of the screen into (over?) the tank
    - also, finish function shakeFood so that the animation is less freaky

 * make function produceFood (in fishFood) that clones foodBits and makes them fall from the container

 * in fish class, make function eatFood that lets fish eat foodBits
    - when fish touches foodBit, its mouth opens and the foodBit disappears
